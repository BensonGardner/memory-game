# Another Memory Game

## About
This game was written by Benson Gardner to complete the requirements of the Udacity "Memory Game" project. 

This project was created from scratch, without any "starter code."

## Elements
The game consists of ```index.html```, ```style.css```, and ```game.js```. After loading ```index.html```, selecting a card starts the game.

## Fun Facts
Emojis are used for the star icons.

The content on the face up side of the cards reflects the developer's love of absurdism.
